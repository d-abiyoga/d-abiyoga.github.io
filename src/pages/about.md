I was a Mechanical Engineer. I've been graduated Bachelor of Science with Mechanical Engineering major. For 5 years I worked as Mechanical Engineer in an EPC company. In those years, not only I learned practical skills in mechanical engineering world, but also exposed with project management and international clients, vendors, and co-workers. But my curiousity for computer related thingsalways itching me.

Luckily, I've been given a task to administer and develop an internal database for our department. I learned PHP and SQL from YouTube. It really was a great experience. Jumping into the rabbithole to learn programming online, I took course from Udemy, CS50, and many other free sources online. Excitement fills my mind when I learned those topics. It's a really different world from my previous field of work.

I learned that there's a thing called open source projects out there, talks that given by experts in their fields freely available in YouTube, and even there's a twitch streamers that do live programming. It feels like I found a part of the world where everybody seems like passionate about things they do. That was when I decide to leave my previous work, to pursue career on software development.

For months I've taught myself about software development from various online sources and landed my first job as a Backend Engineer.
