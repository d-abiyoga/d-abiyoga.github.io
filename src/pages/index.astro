      <p>
        I formerly work as a Mechanical Engineer for 5 years. I took a leap of
        faith to taught myself about software development from various online
        sources and landed my first job as a <mark class=""
          >Backend Engineer</mark
        >. I believe in online learning. Mostly write my code in Golang and
        Typescript.
