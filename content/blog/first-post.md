I have been countlessly trying to create a blog as an outlet of my thought. Most of the time, I only post one or two article and then abandoned the blog. I was too afraid that my writing was not good enought to be published. I thought I should be an expert to post things in the Internet.

My view about publishing content online shifted in the last few years. My interest grew to ideas like Zettelkasten, Evergreen Notes, and [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). I view writing as an open ended process. Our writing does not need to be perfect at the first time. Instead, those scattered ideas adds up piece by piece and might turned into insight.

## What I wish I could achieve with this website?

I foresee it might be hard to balance between _write-whatever-popped-in-my-mind_ and _ready-to-publicly-consumed_ writings. But since the goal of this site itself is for learning, it is worth experimenting.

I also wish I could integrate my workflow from my private digital garden (which I keep offline) to produce some writings that I could publish online (that I hope can also be in digital garden format)

## Why create a blog when writing platform have more reach if I want?

Nowadays, many platforms offer people who traditionally blog to post their writings there to get better exposure to their target audience. But, depend on the use case, the ready-to-use services is not always a best choice.

I choose writing on my own site because it is learning opportunity. Since my daily job only revolved in Backend side. It is feels good to fiddle with frontend side.

In addition, since I start learning software development, I am more aware with freedom in computing. For example, I built this site with Astro and all the content is written in Markdown format. I can preview the markdown in a closed source app like Obsidian.md or a simple text editor like vim. _I own what I write_.

Furthermore, I want to have more control with the platform. If I use third party platform, I don't know if some changes will happen in the future that might affect what and how I write happen. For example, our understanding of some concept will change over time. I want to be able to change my writing flexibly without losing the history. By publishing in simple markdown that is version controlled with [git](https://git-scm.com/), I can trace back to my edited writings anytime I want.

## Last words

Lastly, I wish I could learn a lot and have fun by building this site.
